# Names of God
This project is inspired by the classic science fiction short story "The Nine Billion Names of God," written by Arthur C. Clarke. In this story, a group of monks are trying to write out all of the 9 Billion names of God, as they believe that once they do so, the purpose of the universe will be achieved and it would thus end.
The monks in the story had identified a number of requirements that make up a valid name for the Almighty. Unfortunately, not all of these requirements were listed in the short story, but there are at least two that we know of:
    1) Each valid name can have no more than nine characters.
    2) In each valid name, there can be no substrings of the same character that are greater than three characters (e.g., the substring "AAA" is valid, but the substring "AAAA" is not).
The monks in the story apparently had their own special alphabet for writing out these names of God. However, since no details about this alphabet were ever provided in the short story, not even the number of characters in the alphabet, I am forced to simply use the ASCII character set.
Given these restrictions, and the lack of information, I doubt I will be printing any of the actual nine billion names of God. But if, by some ironic miracle, running this program does print all of the nine billion names of God, keep an eye on the night sky.
Just in case the stars begin to go out, you don't want to miss your last chance to see them.
